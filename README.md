# Pet-Feeding-Robot

This is a project for the course Engineering Exploration in the 1st semester of Engineering.

A pet feeding robot is a convenient and reliable solution for feeding your pet on time. This smart device simplifies daily tasks by automating the feeding process. The user-friendly interface makes it easy to set feeding schedules and portions to suit your pet's needs. The robot's precise dispensing mechanism ensures accurate and clean food dispensing. No more worrying about missing meals or overeating, enjoy the convenience of a robotic feeder that efficiently and accurately manages your pet's nutrition. In this project, we developed this robot using Agile methodologies. We have designed and developed a prototype for this.
